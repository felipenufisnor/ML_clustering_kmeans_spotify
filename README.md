Applied Clustering: K-Means for Recommendation on Spotify

In this project I understood how music recommendation systems work;
I knew and used unsupervised machine learning methods for song classification;
I found out what criteria and characteristics of the songs are used for the recommendation;
I created a music recommender and connected to the Spotify API;
Finally, I connected with the Spotify API more deeply with the Spotipy library.
